[Locations ready for Shadowy Supertaggers](https://github.com/teambtcmap/btcmap-data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alocation-submission+no%3Aassignee)

All location submissions that still need to be added to [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.com) have an open issue in this repository with the label `location-submission`.

You can filter the issues by this label and by issues that are not assigned to anybody.

Please assign yourself to the issue indicating that you are working on this. 

When completed paste the newly added OSM link into the issue so others can verify it was added successfully. 

Once verified we will close the issue.

You can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/teambtcmap/btcmap.org/wiki/Tagging-Instructions#shadowy-supertaggers) for more details on how to add locations to OpenStreetMap and become a Shadowy Supertagger ðŸ¥·.

Thanks for your contribution to the bitcoin mapping community!
