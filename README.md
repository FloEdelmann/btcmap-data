## Contributing

[Locations ready for Shadowy Supertaggers](https://github.com/teambtcmap/btcmap-data/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alocation-submission+-label%3Aassigned)

All location submissions from [btcmap.org](https://btcmap.org/add-location) that still need to be added to [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.com) have an open issue in this repository with the label `location-submission` and no `assigned` label.

You can filter the issues by these labels (see link above).

Please comment on an open issue indicating that you are working on this and we will add the `assigned` label. 

When completed paste the newly added OSM link into the issue so others can verify it was added successfully. 

Once verified we will close the issue.

You can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/teambtcmap/btcmap.org/wiki/Tagging-Instructions#shadowy-supertaggers) for more details on how to add locations to OpenStreetMap and become a Shadowy Supertagger ðŸ¥·.

Thanks for your contribution to the bitcoin mapping community!
